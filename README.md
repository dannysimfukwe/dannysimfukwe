Hi there 👋  

I ❤️ Ruby on Rails, building products, and enabling businesses to grow through tech.  

💼 **Currently working at** Nawiri Group  
🚀 **Built** [Eaziebuy.com](https://eaziebuy.com) – A mobile-first ecommerce builder  

📚 I’m passionate about:  
- Helping businesses create seamless online stores  
- Combining creativity with functionality in product development  
- Sharing knowledge and learning from the indie hacker community  

🔴 **Failed Projects:**  
- **Kooclock** – VoIP & Email service  
- **Megamatic Ads** – Facebook Ads management platform  
- ...and many other lessons disguised as failures 😅
